# ChrestomathyCode
> [Chrestomathy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chrestomathy) is a collection of literary passages, designed to help in learning a language.

## Purpose
ChrestomathyCode is meant to be a chrestomathy for code. This project is inspired by [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org) website. As they say:
> The idea is to present solutions to the same task in as many different languages as possible, to demonstrate how languages are similar and different, and to aid a person with a grounding in one approach to a problem in learning another.

On top of that, ChrestomathyCode provides a way to test and benchmark the code across different programming languages.


## Usage
You should have Python 3.9+ installed. For tests only pytest is needed.

This will validate all the tasks
```
python chrestomathy_code.py
```
You can filter the tasks or the language
```
python chrestomathy_code.py java
python chrestomathy_code.py factorial
```
